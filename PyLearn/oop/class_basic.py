# Prviate variables
# Please note that private variables (vars starting with '_' )don't exist in Python. 
# There are simply norms to be followed. The language itself don't apply any restrictions.
# These are generally used in cojuction with property, see property example

# A better aproach is using __ which causes 'mangling', see mangling example.
