	# .readline(size=-1)	This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
	# .readlines()	This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

	#writing
	# .write(string)	This writes the string to the file.
	# .writelines(seq)	This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. Itâ€™s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).
