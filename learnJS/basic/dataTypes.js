/*
In JS everything is either a object or a primitive data type
*/

// Numbers
let a = 10  // note a is automatically of float type even though its not visible
console.log(a)

// strings
let b = 'joydeep'

// boolean
let c = true

// undefined
let d = undefined // by default any uninitialized variable is set to undefined

// null
let e = null
